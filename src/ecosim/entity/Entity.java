 * 
 * The Entity has an abstract update method which will need to be 
 * defined in any descendant classes. If this object is added to the
 * GameEngine using GameEngine.add(obj), its paint method and 
 * update method will be called automatically 60 times per second.
 * 
 * The Animal class in your EcoSim should extend from this class so
 * that any of its descendants can also be drawn to the screen
 * automatically.
