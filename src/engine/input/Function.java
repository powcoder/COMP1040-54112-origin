/**
 * A KeyFunction can be added to Keyboard keys and Mouse buttons.
 * These buttons will invoke the associated KeyFunction's 
 * execute method when they are pressed.
 * 
 * The KeyFunction can be constructed with a delay. If the delay is set
 * to a number greater than zero, the function will execute again if the 
 * button is held for that many milliseconds. This will repeat while the 
 * button is held. Call the update(long millis), to tell the KeyFunction 
 * how many milliseconds have passed since the last execution. This method
 * is called automatically for each KeyFunction on the Keyboard and Mouse.
 * 
 * To construct a custom KeyFunction, you should define an anonymous class.
 * For example:
 * KeyFunction func = new KeyFunction(){
 * 	@Override
 * 	public void execute(){
 * 		System.out.println("Do something");
 * 	}
 * };
