/**
 * The ICollidable interface provides methods for checking if this
 * object has collided with another object. To do this, you will need
 * to check that this object's bounds intersects with the other 
 * object's bounds.
 * 
 * If your class implements the ICollidable interface, it can be added 
 * to the GameEngine. If an ICollidable object has been added to the 
 * GameEngine, it will call collidedWith between your object and all
 * other ICollidable objects in the GameEngine. If any have collided,
 * it will call onCollision to process the collision event.
